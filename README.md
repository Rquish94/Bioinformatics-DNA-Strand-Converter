# Bioinformatics-DNA-Strand-Converter
This was a school project requiring us to translate a given DNA strand

The script reads from a file containing the DNA strand, typically DNA strands would need to be stored in file (size issue). 
Once its running it prompts a user to input the file name. It then converts the DNA strand to:

Original, RNA, Complement of RNA, Reverse Complement, Translated Reverse Complement. 
It then outputs the reading frames.
